Hi! I am Santwana. 

To start with, I did my BTech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology
Kanpur. I am mostly interested in Signals & Systems and Communications
when it comes to Electrical Engineering. I am also interested in
Systems. Throughout my stay at IIT Kanpur, I have explored areas such as
Image Processing, Software Development, Systems etc through my course
projects and general interests.

My interests lie in reading books, developing stuff and procrastinating about learning violin.
