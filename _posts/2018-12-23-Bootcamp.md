This blog is written in an attempt to introduce beginners to various
things you could experiment with, when it comes to computer science and
engineering. (<em>Note:</em> This blog will essentially not cover the
theory part, despite the fact that it comprises the major part of CSE.
We might cover it in the future since according to us this blog is
something which we will keep updating in the future.)

<b>Before staring we would like to mention a few important points:</b>

* Shift to `Linux`. Give up your love for windows. If you are from IIT
	Kanpur, programming club holds <em>Linux Install Fest</em> at regular intervals in an year (<b> Once in summers </b> and <b> once at the start of even semester.</b>).
	Linux has several distros. [ArchLinux](https://www.ubuntu.com/), [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/), [Kali](https://www.kali.org/), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/),
	[Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) and [Nix](https://nixos.org/) are just to name a few. You might want
	to check out the information regarding various distributions but the
	general recommendation is to start with <b>Ubuntu</b>.
* You could read the [installation guide by pclub, IIT Kanpur.](http://pclub.in/installfest17/2017/01/06/installfest.html)
* Learn `Git`. <em>Almost</em> all of us have, at some stage, named our
	codes/files as `final`, `finalfinal`, `lastfinal` or
	`finalwithminorchanges`. It is time to say goodbye to this
	practice (for a greater good). Git is a <b>version control
	system</b> which allows you to keep track of your work and allows
	you to collaborate with other people on a project without having to
	send zip files each time you make a change.

* Programming Languages
	* The best way to learn a programming language is by writing programs in the same.
	* Here are a few programming languages, out of which you must know
		<b>at least</b> one:
		* C++
		* Java
		* Python
	* Sources for the above mentioned languages are as follows:
		* C++: [C++ in a nutshell](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596002985.do)
		* Java: [Headfirst Java](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-java/0596009208/), [Oracle Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
		* Python: [Python in a nutshell](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596001889.do)
* Focus on IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Realise that an IDE
	might be really helpful when working on large projects. Some examples of
	IDES are [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org),
	[Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) etc.
* Editors: When working with a standalone file or with a small project, a
	good editor might come in more handy than an IDE. Some examples of
	editors are
	[Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) etc.
* <b>IDE vs Editor:</b> Apart from being comfortable with both IDEs and
	editors, it is also important to know when to use an IDE and when to
	use an editor. Follow this [link](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/12/22/ide-vs-text-editor/) to convince yourself.
* <b>Art of Googling:</b> Art of Googling makes you good coder, in an easy way. Please realize that you are programmer/coder/developer and not a poet. It is not advisable to search for “What are the differences between X and Y” instead of searching “X vs Y”.

## Now starting with the actual Divisions:

* Development (Broadly web and android/iOS app)
* Competitive Programming
* Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
* DevOps
* Cyber Security
* Systems

## Web Development

Client, server, DNS, frontend, backend, you’ve heard of all those terms -- [but how exactly does the web work](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)? This article explains basic concepts.

Have you wondered [“What happens when you type google.com into your browser's address box and press enter?”](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when). You may not understand most part of this, but keep visiting this link over months or semesters and every time, you will be able to understand more of it.

### Web Development: Frontend

Frontend is what goes on in the client (see article above). Basically, whatever you see on your browser: the content, the style, and the interactivity.

* Learn HTML [MDN HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML) and also take a look at [pclub, IITK intro to HTML/CSS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X954pXQTwFQpuHGjTU952-1uwwMtRvo4nHUM6xQUosg/edit#slide=id.p).
* The most widely used language is `Javascript`. To get started with it you can follow the links given below:
	* [Head First JavaScript](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-javascript/9781449340124/)
	* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)
* Make MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) your best friend
* Beautify your work by the art of [CSS](https://html.com/css/)(Cascading Style Sheets)

### Web Development: Backend

Backend is what goes on in the server (see article above). Server responds to requests coming from the clients.
* You should be familiar with JavaScript. In particular, brush up on [callbacks](https://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced?gi=fecf64f018ae).
* We’ll use Nodejs to run JavaScript on the backend. Try completing  [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode).
* You can try [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) to develop a complete site using Nodejs!

## App Development

* Learn Java or [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) (Its pretty famous among the app developers these
	days, also if you know Java, its pretty much the same. It won't hurt
	to have a new language in your stack).
* The links are given above.
* Go through the [developers page](https://developer.android.com/) for Android Development.
* There are multiple other frameworks to start Android Development but
	the best would be to start with Android Studio.

## Machine Learning

<b><em>NOTE:</em></b> Machine learning is a fast growing division and probably a lot of people will tell you about career prospects of Machine Learning and also that it has high paying jobs at its expense. Please realize that if you are not good at what you do, you should not hope for the prospects it offers. A lot of people take up Machine Learning ( and Artificial Intelligence) due to bandwagon effect. Machine Learning involves intensive use of mathematics (have a look at the course website of Machine Learning Techniques, Probabilistic Machine Learning to decide if this is the right thing for you).

Now, if you have convinced yourself to pursue this further, you could
start with the following resources:

* [Coursera course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
* If you have completed the course and the assignment it offers
	(<b>actually completed</b>), proceed to explore it even further by looking
	at [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/) tool for machine Learning.
* [Keras](https://keras.io).
* If you have reached this stage, we respect you. Enhance your skills by specialised courses offered by Andrew Ng on [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.deeplearning.ai).

## Competitive Programming

<b><em>Note:</em></b> If you wish to take up a job after your degree completion, it is advisable to continue solving problems of competitive programming since all the tests of almost all companies is based on question solving even if the profile is SDE (It’s unfair, I know :( ).

* Please take a course on Data Structures and Algorithms.
* Take a look at the course from [MIT open course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/).
* If you are from IITK, join Google group of IITK for competitive programming.
* Learn at least one language out of the three mentioned in the Must Know Languages section. To learn a language you can take a look at [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) which offers small questions (usually you need to implement a function and not the entire code). This is useful to understand key functionalities of the language.

## Linux Kernel Programming

It is unusual for someone to get into Linux Kernel Programming at an
early stage like this, but if you have interest in lkp, try out the
following book and let us know in case you need further information.
* Books recommended: [Linux Kernel Programming in a nutshell](http://www.kroah.com/lkn/)
