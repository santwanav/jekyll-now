#Bootcamp
##This is essentially a beginner's guide

Before staring I would like to mention a few important points:

* Shift to `Linux`. Give up your love for windows. If you are from IIT
	Kanpur, programming club holds <em>Linux Install fest</em> at regular intervals in an year (<b> Once in summers </b> and <b> once at the start of even semester.</b>).
	Linux has several distros, <em>ArchLinux, Ubuntu, Kali, Fedora,
	Gentoo</em> and <em>Nix</em> are just to name a few. You might want
	to check out the information regarding various distributions but the
	general recommendation is to start with <b>Ubuntu</b>.
	(Other colleges must have such fests too, maybe contact
	the programming/cyber club or any related cell of your college).
* Learn `Git`. <em>Almost</em> all of us have at come stage named our
	codes/files as `final`, `finalfinal`, `lastfinal` or
	`finalwithminorchanges`. It is time to say goodbye to this
	practice (for a greater good). Git is a <b>version control
	system</b> which allows you to keep track of your work and allows
	you to collaborate with other people on a project without having to
	send zip files each time you make a change.
	You know what we mean.
* Programming Languages
	* The best way to learn a programming language is by writing programs in the same.
